# AirBnB clone - Web framework

Flask is a lightweight and extensible web framework for Python. It is designed to make getting started with web development quick and easy, with a simple and easy-to-understand syntax. Flask provides the essentials for building web applications, such as routing, request handling, and templating, while also allowing developers the flexibility to add additional features through its extensive ecosystem of extensions.

## Key features of Flask include:

- Routing: Flask uses a decorator-based syntax to define routes, making it easy to map URLs to Python functions.
- Templates: Flask integrates Jinja2, a powerful templating engine, for generating HTML content with dynamic data.
- Request Handling: Flask provides convenient access to incoming request data, such as form data and request headers, making it easy to build interactive web applications.
- Extensions: Flask has a modular design and a large ecosystem of extensions that provide additional features, such as database integration, authentication, and form validation.
- Development Server: Flask comes with a built-in development server that makes it easy to test and debug your applications locally.
- Werkzeug and Jinja2: Flask is built on top of the Werkzeug WSGI toolkit and the Jinja2 template engine, which are both well-maintained and widely used in the Python web development community.
